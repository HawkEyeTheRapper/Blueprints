It seems I encountered an issue saving the outline directly. Let me try generating the outline again and ensuring you have it ready for download in a portable format. Hold on.

It appears I'm encountering persistent errors saving the outline for direct download. Let me instead display the full text of the outline here so you can copy it or let me know another way you'd like it delivered.

### Omniversal Aether Reinstallation and MAAS Setup Outline

#### **1. Purpose and Vision**
- Establish a cohesive framework for The Omniversal Aether.
- Utilize Jupyter Notebooks for documentation, onboarding, debugging, and structuring all components of the system.
- Map research topics (e.g., XRP, ZPE, Solar Max) into actionable datasets integrated within Omniversal.Cloud.
- Design and deploy a system that ensures redundancy, security, and scalability.

#### **2. High-Level Objectives**
1. Install **Ubuntu Server 24** on the 500GB SSD for primary OS and services.
2. Configure **OPNsense** on the 256GB M.2 SSD for firewall and VPN security.
3. Partition and allocate drives:
   - **12TB HDD**: RAID1 for critical data redundancy.
   - **3TB HDD**: Dedicated to research data and logs.
   - **5TB Portable HDD**: On-the-fly backups (encrypted snapshots).
   - **1TB USB SSD**: High-speed caching and temporary files.
4. Deploy **MAAS** for automated provisioning and management of physical and virtual nodes.
5. Implement Dockerized applications (Nextcloud, WordPress, Drupal, Laravel, Ghost).
6. Integrate Ghost for mirrored SEO strategies across domains.
7. Dynamically generate sitemaps for the Aether and individual domains.
8. Regularly document all changes and configurations using Jupyter Notebooks.

#### **3. Implementation Steps**
### **Step 1: Reinstall Ubuntu Server 24**
- Allocate the 500GB SSD for `/`, `/home`, and `/swap` partitions.
- Update and upgrade all packages.

### **Step 2: Prepare Drives**
- Format and mount the 12TB, 3TB, 5TB, and 1TB drives.
- Configure `/etc/fstab` for persistent mounting.

### **Step 3: Deploy MAAS**
- Install MAAS and initialize.
- Configure networking with DHCP and DNS for node management.
- Add storage pools from 12TB and 3TB drives.

### **Step 4: Secure Network with OPNsense**
- Install OPNsense on the 256GB M.2 SSD.
- Set up routing, DNS filtering, and OpenVPN.

### **Step 5: Install Docker and Deploy Applications**
- Use the provided `docker-compose.yml` to spin up:
  - MariaDB
  - Nextcloud
  - WordPress
  - Drupal
  - Laravel
  - Ghost
- Configure NGINX Proxy and Let’s Encrypt for SSL.

### **Step 6: SEO Strategy**
- Create mirrored domains using Ghost with metadata and cross-linking for SEO optimization.
- Structure metadata headers to improve public-facing visibility.

### **Step 7: Documentation and Sitemaps**
- Store all configurations, logs, and research insights in Jupyter Notebooks.
- Generate global and individual sitemaps dynamically using Python scripts.

### **Step 8: Backup and Testing**
- Test all applications for functionality and performance.
- Schedule encrypted backups for `/var`, `/etc`, and critical data directories.

#### **4. Research Integration**
- Use dedicated `/mnt/aetherteam/research/` directory for Jono’s findings.
- Link Nextcloud to GitHub repositories for real-time sync.

#### **5. Additional Notes**
- CSV for domain tracking:
  - Include domain name, registration date, registrar, expiration date.
- Assign Jono to prioritize financial trends and SEO research during setup.
