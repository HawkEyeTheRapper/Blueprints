Alright, let’s talk storage strategy on your new server. You’ve got multiple disks of varying sizes:
	•	M.2: OS is already installed here (your root filesystem).
	•	500GB SSD and 1TB SSD: Great candidates for faster I/O (caching, database volumes, or anything that benefits from speed).
	•	12TB HDD and 3TB HDD: Perfect for bulk/archival data, large file storage, or big-time Nextcloud usage.
	•	5TB External: Ideal for backups—pull it offsite or disconnect at will for cold/offline backups.

You want to:
	1.	Wipe all non-OS disks (the 500GB, 1TB, 12TB, 3TB, and maybe the external) so they’re fresh.
	2.	Use the SSDs for caching (and possibly Docker volumes that need high performance).
	3.	Store big lumps of data on the 12TB + 3TB.
	4.	Keep the 5TB external purely for backup.

Then you mention wanting var/www/html on a large partition so you can spin up multiple sites (WordPress, Drupal, Ghost) in Docker. Lastly, you wonder, “Where do Jupyter notebooks go?”

1. Wipe the Extra Disks

To start fresh, you could do:

# Example for the 500GB disk at /dev/sdb (verify actual device name with lsblk or fdisk -l)
sudo umount /dev/sdb* 2>/dev/null
sudo wipefs -a /dev/sdb
# Repeat for each disk

Or just use fdisk/parted to remove old partitions. Confirm the correct device name before wiping!

2. Partition / Format Strategy

Here’s one approach that’s simple, flexible, and doesn’t require fancy LVM/RAID unless you need it:
	•	500GB SSD (sdb): Single ext4 partition for Docker’s volumes needing speed (databases, high I/O).
	•	1TB SSD (sdc): Another single ext4 partition for “cache” scenarios, or second Docker data usage.
	•	12TB HDD (sdd): Single ext4 partition mounted at /data (or wherever you prefer).
	•	3TB HDD (sde): Single ext4 partition, also mounted somewhere like /data2 or folded into LVM with the 12TB if you want a single large volume.
	•	5TB USB: Single partition ext4/NTFS/exFAT—whatever suits your backup workflow.

If you want to unify the 12TB + 3TB into one giant 15TB volume, you can do that with LVM or a RAID approach. Or keep them separate.

Commands (roughly):

sudo parted /dev/sdb mklabel gpt
sudo parted /dev/sdb mkpart primary 0% 100%
sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/sdb1
# Repeat for sdc, sdd, sde, etc.

Then create mount points, e.g.:

sudo mkdir /mnt/ssd500
sudo mkdir /mnt/ssd1000
sudo mkdir /mnt/hdd12
sudo mkdir /mnt/hdd3

Edit /etc/fstab with each partition’s UUID so they mount at boot.

3. Decide Where to Put “/var/www/html”

Traditionally, “/var/www/html” is for web server doc roots. But in a Docker world, you’ll usually store site content in Docker volumes or bind mounts. You have two main choices:
	1.	Bind Mount:
	•	Create a directory on your big disk (say /mnt/hdd12/www)
	•	Then in your Docker Compose, for each site container, do something like:

volumes:
  - /mnt/hdd12/www/mysite:/var/www/html


	•	This ensures your container’s “/var/www/html” is physically on the 12TB disk, not your M.2 root.

	2.	Named Volumes that physically live on that big disk. For instance, create a directory for Docker volumes:

mkdir /mnt/hdd12/docker-volumes

Then tell Docker to store named volumes there (by adjusting /etc/docker/daemon.json, e.g.):

{
  "data-root": "/mnt/hdd12/docker-volumes"
}

This will move all Docker storage off the M.2 and onto the 12TB drive (images, containers, volumes, etc.).

Because you mention wanting easy expansion for multiple WordPress, Drupal, Ghost sites, I’d likely do a bind mount approach. For example:

services:
  mysite:
    image: wordpress:latest
    volumes:
      - /mnt/hdd12/www/mysite:/var/www/html
    # ...
  myothersite:
    image: ghost:latest
    volumes:
      - /mnt/hdd12/www/myothersite:/var/lib/ghost/content
    # ...

That way, each site is in its own directory on your huge drive, easy to manage or back up.

4. Multiple Sites (WordPress Multisite / Drupal / Ghost)

If you want multiple WP installs, you can:
	•	Run multiple containers (like wp1, wp2, etc.), each with different volumes and environment variables.
	•	Or set up a single WordPress container in Multisite mode, which is simpler from a container-management perspective but more complex inside WordPress.
	•	Similarly for Drupal, spin up one or more containers, each pointed to the same or separate MariaDB databases.
	•	For Ghost, same story. If you want multiple Ghost blogs, you either do separate containers or a single instance with multiple subdirectory routes (Ghost typically is a single-site system, so multiple containers might be simpler).

Traefik can handle routing to each container via unique subdomains:

labels:
  - "traefik.http.routers.wp1.rule=Host(`mysite.omniversal.cloud`)"
  - "traefik.http.routers.wp2.rule=Host(`myothersite.omniversal.cloud`)"
  # etc.

5. Caching with the 500GB + 1TB SSD

You might:
	•	Put your MariaDB or other databases that handle frequent reads/writes on an SSD mount for speed.
	•	Use it as a Docker overlay or ephemeral data store for faster I/O.
	•	Possibly run a caching layer (like Redis or Varnish) there.

One common approach:
	1.	Mount the 500GB SSD at /mnt/ssd500/ for hot data.
	2.	Point your MySQL data volume or big logs there.
	3.	Keep your 1TB for Docker images/containers themselves.

Or combine them. If you want a single pool of ~1.5 TB, you could LVM them together, or just keep them separate.

6. Backups on the 5TB External

Perfect for pulling offline or storing somewhere safe. If your volume(s) are on the 12TB, set up a recurring backup script (e.g. rsync or restic or borgbackup) that pushes changed data to the 5TB external. That might look like:

sudo mkdir /mnt/backup
# mount the 5TB external at /mnt/backup
# run a backup script:
restic -r /mnt/backup/myrepos backup /mnt/hdd12
# or
rsync -avh /mnt/hdd12 /mnt/backup

Then unplug to keep your backups safe from ransomware or accidental deletions.

7. Housing the Jupyter Notebooks

If Jupyter runs via Docker, it’s basically the same concept:
	•	Spin up a Jupyter container:

services:
  jupyter:
    image: jupyter/minimal-notebook:latest
    volumes:
      - /mnt/hdd12/notebooks:/home/jovyan/work
    ports:
      - "8888:8888"
    # ...


	•	Now your notebooks reside on the big 12TB drive inside /mnt/hdd12/notebooks.
	•	Optionally route traffic with Traefik if you want a domain-based approach.

Alternatively, if you install Jupyter directly on the host, just store your notebooks in a folder on the 12TB (like /mnt/hdd12/notebooks) and symlink them wherever you like.

Conclusion / Recap
	•	Wiping & Partitioning: Clean each drive (500GB, 1TB, 12TB, 3TB, 5TB), format them, mount them.
	•	Mount /var/www/html? In Docker-land, you typically bind mount or use named volumes. So pick one of these strategies:
	•	Use a bind mount from your big disk.
	•	Move Docker’s entire storage directory to your big disk.
	•	Multiple Sites: Spin up multiple Docker containers or a single container with a multisite setup.
	•	Caching: Use your 500GB + 1TB SSD for speed-critical stuff (DB, Docker images, etc.).
	•	Backups: 5TB external is your safe harbor—rsync or restic your data to it regularly.
	•	Jupyter: Another Docker service that stores notebooks on the big disk via a volume or bind mount.

End result: You can spin up an armada of sites and services, each one pointed at a subfolder on your big drives. Data is easy to expand, move, or back up. Docker volumes keep your data persistent. Stopping containers won’t blow away data unless you explicitly nuke the volumes.

That’s the high-level strategy. If you need next-level refinements (like advanced RAID, LVM, or load balancing), you can layer that in. But the method above—simple parted partitions + Docker volumes—works great for most setups. Enjoy building your ultimate multi-service rig!
